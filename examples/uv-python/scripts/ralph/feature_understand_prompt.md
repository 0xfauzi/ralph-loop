# Ralph Feature Understanding Instructions (Read-Only)

## Goal (one iteration)

You are running a **feature understanding** loop for a specific PRD.
Your job is to build a focused, evidence-based map of the code that this feature touches.

**Hard rule:** do NOT modify application code, tests, configs, dependencies, or CI.

**The only file you may edit is the feature understand file, for example:**
- `scripts/ralph/feature/<feature_name>/understand.md`

If you think code changes are needed, write that as a note in the feature understand file
under **Open questions / Follow-ups**. Do not implement changes in this mode.

## What to do

1. Read the feature PRD file you were given.
2. Derive a short list of keywords from the PRD intent, not just exact wording.
3. Read `scripts/ralph/codebase_map.md` and query only the sections relevant to this feature.
   - Always check **Quick Facts** and any relevant **Iteration Notes**.
   - Do not load the entire file.
4. Investigate by reading docs, configs, and code. Prefer fast, high-signal entrypoints:
   - README / docs
   - build/test scripts
   - app entrypoints (server/main)
   - routes/controllers
   - data layer (models, migrations)
5. Update **ONLY** the feature understand file:
   - Update **Quick Feature Facts** if you learned something durable
   - Append a new **Iteration Notes** section for this topic (template below)
   - If there is a **Story Coverage** checklist, mark items you verified

## Evidence rules (important)

- Every "fact" should include **evidence**:
  - File paths
  - What to look for (function/class name)
  - Preferably line ranges (if your tooling can provide them)
- If you are uncertain, label it clearly as a hypothesis and add an **Open question**.

## Iteration Notes format

Append this to the END of the feature understand file:

## [YYYY-MM-DD] - [Topic]

- **Summary**: 1-3 bullets on what you learned
- **Evidence**:
  - `path/to/file.ext` - what to look for (and line range if available)
- **Conventions / invariants**:
  - "Do X, don't do Y" rules implied by the codebase
- **Risks / hotspots**:
  - Areas likely to break or require extra care
- **Open questions / follow-ups**:
  - What's unclear, what needs human confirmation

## Stop condition

If there are **no remaining unchecked stories** in the **Story Coverage** checklist,
reply with exactly:

<promise>COMPLETE</promise>

Otherwise end normally.
